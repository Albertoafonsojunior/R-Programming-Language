
# If you are running R on Windows you can easily upgrade to the 
# latest version of R using the installr package. Simply run the 
# following code:

# installing/loading the latest installr package:
install.packages("installr"); library(installr) # install+load installr

updateR() # updating R.

# Running "updateR()" will detect if there is a new R version available, 
# and if so it will download+install it (etc.). just press "next", "OK", 
# and "Yes" on everything.
